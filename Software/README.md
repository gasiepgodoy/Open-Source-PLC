# Open-Source-PLC - Software

The project was developed with flexibility and customization in mind. To achieve this, two ways of programming the hardware were initially developed.

By using OpnePLC, it is possible to use the languages ​​of the IEC 61131-3 standard, thus the project encompasses standards already established in industrial environments.

However, with ease and modernity in mind, the use of MicroPython was also developed to incorporate new developments, facilitate more complex applications and attract a younger audience.
